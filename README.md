# XenergY

The project involves an analysis of energy consumption time series data to create a predictive model using XGBoost to forecast future energy consumption. It begins with data preprocessing, where the dataset is loaded and exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed, which includes visualizations of energy consumption by hour, day, month, and year. Feature engineering is then applied, and the data is split into training and test sets for the model. Model evaluation is then conducted, and metrics such as RMSE and MAE are calculated. At the end, I do a brief error analysis, identifying the best and worst forecasted days, and suggestions based on error findings such as considering holidays in the analysis due to their impact on energy consumption.

Time series forecasting is highly valuable for businesses in various ways, as it enables them to make informed decisions and improve their operations:

`Demand Forecasting`
> Businesses can use time series forecasting to predict future demand for their products or services. This helps in optimizing inventory management, ensuring that they have the right amount of stock on hand, reducing carrying costs, and preventing stockouts or overstock situations.

`Financial Planning`
> Accurate forecasts are crucial for financial planning. Companies can use time series analysis to project future revenues, expenses, and cash flows, aiding in budgeting, resource allocation, and overall financial stability.

`Optimizing Production and Supply Chain` 
> In manufacturing and supply chain management, time series forecasting can be used to predict production needs, optimize scheduling, and reduce wastage. This is crucial for industries where raw materials and production capacity need to be managed effectively.

`Energy and Utilities Management`
> For companies in the energy sector or those with substantial energy consumption, forecasting helps optimize energy use, reduce costs, and ensure reliability such as within this project.

`Trend and Anomaly Detection`
> Time series forecasting can detect abnormal patterns or anomalies in data, which can be indicative of fraud, equipment malfunction, or other issues. Detecting such anomalies early can save a business money and reputation.
